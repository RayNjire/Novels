\par 
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  MARCH 1945
\par 
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The hull of the submarine was lashed to the huge pilings, a behemoth
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   strapped in silhouette, the sweeping lines of its bow arcing into the light
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   of the North Sea dawn.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The base was on the island of Scharh5rn, in th\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 e Helgoland Bight, several
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   miles from the German mainland and the mouth of the Elbe River. It was a
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   refueling station never detected by Allied Intelligence and, in the cause
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   of security, little known among the strategists of the German High Comniand
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   itself. The undersea marauders came and went in darkness, emerging and
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   submerging within several hundred feet of the moorings. They were Neptunes
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   assassins, come home to rest or going forth to press their attacks.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   On this particular dawn, however, \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 the submarine lashed to the dock was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   doing neither. For it, the war was over, its assignment intrinsic to the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   particularly distinguishing about him, except perhaps his eyebrows. They
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   were thick, a mixture of black and light-gray hair that produced the effect
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   of salt-and-pepper archways in the upper regions of a forgettable face.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   At first glance. Yet if one\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  looked closer, one could see the blunted but

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   perfect choice, satisfying both the demands and the objectives of the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel considered what that meant to him personally and professionally. It
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was freedom. Manfredi had said in Geneva that he was talented. He was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   talented, but frequently that talent was obscured in the final product.

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   prohibited time spent on lesser commissions. He was turning into a cynic.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Nothing was permanent; planned obsolescence went hand in hand with
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   depreciation and amortization. No one knew it better than an architect\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  who
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   once had a conscience. Perhaps he would find his conscience again. With
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   freedom. With the two million.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft was startled by the progression of his thoughts. He had made up
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   his mind, something he had not intended to do until he'd thought th\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ings

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He expected it, but i\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 t was still a shock. Ile disorientation was now

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  dwarfed against the expanse of the right wall. As had happened minutes ago,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  when first he'd seen the livi\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ng room, the images of what his bedroom looked
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  like three days ago kept flashing before bm36 replaced by the strangeness of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  what he now observed.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Then he saw it and gasped. Hanging down from the ceiling, strapped together
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   with dull black tape, was his second telephone, the extension cord snaking
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   up the wall and across the ceiling to the hook that held it.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   It was spinning slowly.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The pain shifted from his stomach to his chest; his eyes were transfixed
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   on the sight,\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  on the suspended instrument revolving slowly in midair. He
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was afraid to look beyond, but he knew he had to; he had to understand.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   And when he did, his breath came back to him. The phone was in the direct
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   path of his bathroom door and the door was o\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 pen. He saw the curtains
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   billowing in the window above the basin. The steady stream of cold wind was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   making the telephone spin.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He walked quickly into the bathroom to shut the window. As he was about to
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   pull the curtains, he saw a brief flash of il\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 lumination outside; a match
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   bad been struck in another window across the courtyard, the flare startling
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   in the darkness. He looked out.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   There was the woman againl The blond-haired woman, her upper body
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   silhouetted beyond another set of sheer curtai\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ns. He stared at the figure,

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   She turned as shi had turned before, and walked away as she had walked away
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   minutes ago. Out of sight. And the dim light in the window went out.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   What was happening? What did it mean? Things were being \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 orchestrated to

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft walked out of the bathroom and paused beneath the suspended
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   telephone; it was barely moving now, but it had not stopped. It was an
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   ugly sight, made macabre by the profusion of dull black tape that held the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   It couldn!t be. It was insane. The single sheet of paper was brownish
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   yellow. With age. It was identical to the page that had be\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 en kept in a

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   by fanatics who revered a martyr named Heinrich Clausen. The writIng was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the same; the odd Germanic printing of English words, the ink that was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   faded but stiff legible.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   And what was legible was astonishing. For it had been written more than

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   If he was going to consider lying in his search through this unfamiliar
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   forest, thought Noel, he'd better learn to analyze his minor answers
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   first. Lesson one: preparation.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   'Mere isn'\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 t that much to tell," he said awkwardly. "I'm taking a trip to

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   long time ago." It was a variation on the truth and not a bad one, thought
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft. Perhaps that was why he was ab\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 le to offer it convincingly.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Lesson two: Base the lie in an aspect of truth.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "Yet your . . . friend has tried to locate them and was unable to do so."

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "No, it isn't. It would be far too simple a matter for an attorney to

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   attach6 smiled and shrugged, as if he had delivered a basic lecture in
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   arithmetic.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel watched the Brazilian with growing irritation. Lesson three: Don't be

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "They have to, Mr. Holcroft. Had to. The Nuremberg Tribunals and the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel tensed the muscles of his stomach. There was a connection-abs\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 tract,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   even misleading under the cir cumstances, but it was them The Von Tiebolts
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   were part of a theft so massive and complex it was beyond accounting
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   procedures. But it could not be the reason they had vanished. Lesson four:
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Be prepared for unexpected coincidences, no matter how strained; be ready
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   to conceal reactions.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "I don't think the family could be involved in anything like that," he
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   said.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "But, of course, you're not sure, since you know so little.99

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   his desk. He opened it and held it out for Holcroft, who shook his head.

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "Yes, I know." The attach6 reached for a silver table lighter on the desk,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   snapped it, and inhaled deeply; the tip of the cigar glowed. He raised his

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel saw the urgency in the attach6's eyes. He sat down. "What is it?"
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "La comunidad alemana. I use the Spanish you speak so well."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "rho German community? There's a German community in Rio-is that what you

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "Precisely. 'The underside,' you might say. What makes them what they are;
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   what makes them do what they do. It's important that you understand."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "I think I do. I think you explained it. Most were \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 Nazis getting out of

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   identities. Naturally, such people would tend to stick t6gether."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "Naturally," the Brazilian said. "But youd think after so many years

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   But this was to be no holiday, thought Holcroft, no holiday at all. The

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   and finally decided to go up to the lounge.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He had put off going upstairs. The memory of seven days ago was still
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   discomforting. The unbelievable had happened in front of his eyes; a man
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   had been killed not four feet from where he'd been sitting. A\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 t one point

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Strychnine. A colorless crystalline alkaloid that caused paroxysms of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   unendurable pain. Why had it happened\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ? Who was responsible and for what
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   reason? The accounts were specific, the theories speculative.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Two men had been physically close to the victim in the lounge of Flight 591
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   from London. Either one could have admini te d the poison by way of the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Port Authority police, there was no evidence that the two men had ever
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   known Thornton. And the two men themselves-the suspected killers-had met

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   room, and themselves been murdered. Why? By whom?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   No one had any answers. Only questions. And then even the questions
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   stopped. The sto\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ry faded from the newspapers and the broadcasts as

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  girl on British Airways. The words, even to the use of his name, were
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  uttered in a similar tone, only the accent varied. It was all too much
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  alike. Or was his mind-his eyes, hi\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 s ears, his senses--preoccupied with the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  memory of seven days ago?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He thanked the stewardess, almost afraid to look at her, thinking that any
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   second he would hear a scream beside him and watch a man in uncontrollable

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Then Noel realized something else, and it discomforted him further. He was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   sitting in the same seat he had occupied during those terrifying moments
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   on Flight 591. In a lounge constructed identically wi\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 th that lounge a week

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   there. But now it seemed macabre. His lines of sight were the same, the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   lighting no different now from the way it was then.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   That was scotch on the rocks, \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 wasn't it, Mr. Holcroft?

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He pushed the drink aside. Suddenl\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 y he could no longer stay at that table,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   remain in that lounge. He had to get away; he had to force the images out
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   of his mind. They were too clear, too real, too horrible.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He rose from the chair and walked rapidly, unsteadily, toward the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   staircase\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 . The sounds of drunken laughter weaved in and out between an
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   unrelenting scream of torment that was the screech of sudden death. No one
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   else could hear those sounds, but they pounded in his head.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He lurched down the curving staircase to the deck bel\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ow. The light was dim;
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   several passengers were reading under the beams of tiny spotlights, but
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   most were asleep.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel was bewildered. The hammering in his ears would not stop, the images
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   would not go away. He felt the need to vomit, to expunge the \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 fear that had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   settled into his stomach. Where was the toilet? In the galley ... behind
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the galley? Beyond the curtain; that was it. Or was it? He parted the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   curtain.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Suddenly, his eyes were drawn down to his right, to the front seat of the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   747's second section. A man had stirred in his sleep. A heavyset man whose
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   face he had seen before. He did not recall where, but he was sure of itl
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   A face creased in panic, racing by, close to his. What was it about the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   face? Something had made a b\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 rief but strong impression. What was it?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The eyebrows, that was itl Thick eyebrows, the coiled, matted hair an odd
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   mixture of black and white. Salt-and-pepper eyebrows; where was it? Why did
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the sight of those strangely arresting brows trigger obscur\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 e memories of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   another act of violence? Where was it? He could not remember, and because
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   he could not, he felt the blood rushing to his head. The pounding grew
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   louder; his temples throbbed.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Suddenly, the man with the thick, coiled eyebrows woke up, \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 somehow aware
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   that he was being stared at. Their eyes locked; recognition was absolute.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   And there was violence in that recognition. But of what? When? Where?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319    Holcroft nodded awkwardly, unable to think- The

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  pain in his s\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 tomach was knifelike; the sounds in his head were now cracks of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  thunder. For a moment he forgot where he was; then he remembered and the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  images returned. The sights and sounds of a killing that but for an accident
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  would have claimed his life.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He had t\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 o get back to his seat. He had to control himself, to stop the pain
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   and the thunder and the pounding in his chest. He turned and walked quickly
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   beyond the curtain, past the galley, up the aisle to his seat.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He sat down in the semidarkness, grateful t\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 here was no one beside him. He
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   pressed his head into the rim of the chair and closed his eyes, trying with
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   all his concentration to rid his mind of the terrible sight of a grotesque
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   face, screaming away the last few seconds of life. But he could not.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   That face became his face.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Then the features blurred, as if the flesh were melting, only to be formed
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   again. Thi face that now came into focus was no one he recognized. A
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   strange, angular face, parts of which seemed familiar, but not as a whole.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  involuntarily, he gasped. He had never seen that face but suddenly he knew

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  The clerk behind the desk of the P6rto Alegre Hotel pulled Holcroft's
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  reservation from the file. A small yellow message envelope was stapled to
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  the back of the card. The clerk tore it off and handed it\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  to Noel.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "This came for you shortly past seven o'clock this evening, senhor."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft knew no one in Rio de Janeiro, and had told no one in New York
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   where he was going. He ripped open the flap and drew out the message. It
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was from Sam Buonoventur\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 a. He was to return the overseas call as soon as
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   possible, regardless of the hour.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft looked at his watch; it was nearly midnight. He signed the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   register and spoke-as casually as he could, his mind on Sam.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "I have to telephone Curagao. Will t\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 here be any trouble at this hour?"
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The clerk seemed mildly offended. "Certainly not with our telefonistas,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   senhor. I cannot speak for Curagao."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The origins of the difficulty notwithstanding, it was not until
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   one-fifteen in the morning that he heard Buonoventura's rasping voice over
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the line.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "I think you've got a problem, Noley."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "I've got more than one. What is it?"

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He sat in a cane-backed chair in front of the window and looked out at the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   an absence of character. He focused his eyes on the windowpanes. There was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   nothing to do now but think and rest and hope he could sleep. Sleep had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   been difficult\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  for the past week; it would be more difficult now. Because

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The knowledge produced an odd sensation. He could not believe that there

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Their conversation had been brief; Noel had sought specific information.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The name was Von Tiebolt; the family, German nationals. A mother and two

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   No, it was not an official inquiry. There were no criminal charges; there
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was no seeking of revenge for crimes going back thirty years. On the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   contrary, it was "\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 a benign search."
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel knew that an explanation would be asked of him, and he remembered one
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   of the lessons learned at the consulate in New York: Base the lie in an

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   none with children that could have been Von Tiebolt's. According to Man-

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  railing, watching the grown-up children at their games. The beautiful
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  people, sunning and stunning. Grace and arrogance coexisted with artifice.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  Money was everywhere,\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  evidenced by the golden, oiled bodies, too often too

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  character? It was somehow absent on the Copacabana this afternoon.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He passed that section of the beach that fronted his hotel \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 and glanced up
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   at the windows, trying to locate his room. For a moment he thought he had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   found it, then realized he was wrong. He could see two figures behind the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   glass, beyond the curtains.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He returned to the railing and lit a cigarette. The lighter made him think
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   about the thirty-year-old ledgers so painstakingly doctored. Had they been
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   altered just for him? Or had there been others over the years looking for

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   were the arbiters of the German \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 community. It followed that such men had

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   There was a way to eliminate the danger, Noel thought. It was found in the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   explanation he had given the translator at the Ministry of Immigration. He
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   traveled a great deal, so it was plausible th\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 at someone somewhere had

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the Von Tiebolts. It had to be a person who dealt in legitimate
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   confidentiality, a lawyer or a banker. Someone whose own reputation was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   above reproach\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 . Without analyzing it deeply, Holcroft knew that whoever he
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   decided upon would be the key to his explanation.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   An idea for a candidate struck him, the risks apparent, the irony not lost.

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Noel looked at his watch. It was ten minutes past five-past three in New
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   York. Midafternoon on a Monday. He did not believe in omens, but he had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   just come upon one. Every Monday afternoon Richard Holcroft went to the New
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   York Athletic Club, where o\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ld friends played gentle squash and sat around
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   thick oak tables in the bar and reminisced. Noel could have him paged, talk
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   to him alone--ask for help. Help that was to be rendered confidentially,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   for confidentiality was not only the essence of the co\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ver but the basis of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   his protection. Someone, anyone, had contacted Richard Holcroft-man of
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   statureand asked him to locate a family named Von Tiebolt in Brazil.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Knowing his son was going to Rio, he quite logically asked his son to make
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   inquiries. I\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 t was a confidential matter; it would not be discussed. No one
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   could turn away the curious with greater authority than Dick HoIcroft.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   But Althene was not to be told: That was the hardest part of the request.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Dick adored her; there were no secrets bet\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ween them. But his father-damn

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   need. He never had.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He crossed the smooth marble floor of the hotel lobby toward the bank of

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   'vMey calling you, Mac?" The man pointed toward the front desk.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Behind the counter the clerk was looking at Noel. In \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 his hand was the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   familiar yellow message envelope; he gave it to a bellhop, who started

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The single name on the slip of paper was unknown to him: cARARRA. There was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   a telephone number below, but no message, Holcroft was bewildered.\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  The lark

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Yet, in his room, Holcroft read the name again: cARmmA. His curiosity was
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   aroused. Who was this Cararra that he expected to be called back on the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   That she was somehow connected with the missing Von Tiebolts was the first

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  he had been standing--to where he stood now. His architect's eye was a
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  practiced eye; angles did not deceive him. Too, the windows were not that
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  close to one another, befitting \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 the separation of rooms in an oceanfront
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  hotel on the Copacabana. He looked up at this window, thinking it was not

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  room. And there had been people inside.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He walked to his closet\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  and stood looking at his clothes. He trusted his
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   memory for detail as much as he trusted his eye for angular fines. He
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   pictured the closet where he had changed clothes that morrung. He had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   fallen asleep in the suit he had wom from New York. His ligh\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 t-tan slacks
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   had been on the far right, almost against the closet wall. It was habit:
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   trousers on the right, jackets on the left. The slacks were still on the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   right, but not against the wall. Instead, they were several inches toward
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   the center. His dark-blue blazer was in the center, not on the left side.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319    His clothes had been searched.

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The telephone rang, the sound an intrusion. He picked it up and heard the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   across Noel's chest was momentarily lessened. It was enough.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft shot his left hand up, grabbing the cloth of the extended arm,
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   and pulled\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  forward with all his strength. He angled his body to the right;

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   assailant stumbled. Noel rammed a last shoulder block into the elevated
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   chest, throwing his attacker into an antique c\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 hair against the wall. Man

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Holcroft looked down at the man. The gu\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 akd was large, but his bulk was the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   most threatening part of him. And the bulk was just that; like old Graff,

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   "Don't," said Holcroft. He walked across the large hallway toward the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   front entrance. On the opposite side of the foyer several men and women
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   stood in an open archway. None made a move toward him; none even raised
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   his voice. The German mentality was consistent, thought Noel, not unhappy
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   with the realization. These minions were awaiting orders.

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  Noel slammed the huge door behind him and walked down the marble steps to
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  the car. He swung the automobile into reverse, so that his hood faced the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  downhill drive out of the Graff estate, pressed the accelerator and headed
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319  for the ex\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 it.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Several things occurred to him. The first was that the afternoon sun had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   descended behind the western mountains, creating pockets of shadows on the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   ground. Daylight was disappearing; he needed his headlights. Another
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   concern was that GrafPs rea\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ction to the mention of the Von Tiebolts, had
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   to mean two things: The Von Tiebolts were alive, and they were a threat.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   But a threat to what? To whom? And where were they?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   A third was more of a feeling. than a specific thought. It was his reaction
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   t\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 o the physical encounter he had just experienced. Throughout his life he
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   had taken whatever size and strength he possessed as a matter of course.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Because he was large and relatively well coordinated, he never felt the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   need to seek physical challenge \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 except in competition against himself, in
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   bettering a tennis game or besting a ski slope. As a result, he avoided
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   fights; they struck him as unnecessary.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   It was this general attitude that had made him laugh when his stepfather
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   had insisted he join \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 him at the club for a series of lessons in
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   self-defense. The city was turning into a jungle; Holcroft's son was going
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   to learn how to protect himself.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He took the course, and promptly forgot everything he had learned when it
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was over. If he had act\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ually absorbed anything, he had done it

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He had absorbed something, reflected Noel, pleased with himself. He

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Suddenly, the menacing faces of enormous long-haired black shepherds
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   lunged at the windows on both sides of the car. The dark eyes gliste\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ned
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   with hatred and frustration; the fur-lined, saliva-soaked jaws slapped

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   quarry but unable to sink their teeth into flesh. It was a pack of attack
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   dogs-five, six, seven-at a\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ll-windows now, their paws scratching against

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   Beyond the dog, at the base of the hill, Holcroft saw the huge gate

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The pack on the hill had pulled up behind the gate in the darkening
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   twilight. The explanation had to be that a high-frequency whistle---bey\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 ond

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He came to a fork in the countryside. Did he take the right, or the left?
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   He could not recall; absently he reached for his map on the seat.
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   That was what had bothered himl The map was no longer them. He took the
\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   left fork, reaching below the seat to see if the map had fallen to the

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   knowing he had to keep going. He kept the car at high speed, looking for

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   was full now; he saw nothing he remembered. The road made a wide, sweeping

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   The top of the hill flattened out for approximately a hundred yards. On his

\par \hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319   wall fronting the cliff. Along the wall were rows of telescopes wi\hich\af319\dbch\af31505\loch\f319 th round
